# Mod Installation :
Follow these steps to install the MC2 RTX-Remix mod:

- **Backup**
**Before proceeding with the installation of any mods, it's highly recommended to create a backup of your Midnight Club 2 game files. This will allow you to revert back to the original game state if needed.

- **Download**:

    **1**. Visit the GitHub Desktop website and download the installer file by clicking "Download for Windows".

    **2**. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process.

    **3**. After installation, open GitHub Desktop and sign in to your GitHub account.

    **4**. On the mod's GitHub repository page, locate the "Code" button in the top right corner and click on it. From the dropdown menu, select "Open with GitHub Desktop".

    **5**. In GitHub Desktop, click on "Clone" and choose an empty folder where you want to clone the repository.

    **6**. Wait for the cloning process to finish. This may take a few minutes, especially for larger mods.

    **7**. Copy all the cloned files to your game folder.

# Known Issue :
 - The game crashes when changing scenes (such as when finishing a race and the progress is autosaved) or when restarting the race from a point far away from the starting point.

Let's RTX:
Launch Midnight Club 2 with the RTX enhancements and enjoy the enhanced visuals.
